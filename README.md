### Theme: Building an oil temperature prediction model

#### Project overview

In this training, we will build a prediction model for time series data using oil temperature data. We will start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and finally evaluate the accuracy of the model. We will use machine learning to predict oil temperature and verify its accuracy, aiming for practical application.

#### About the dataset

ETDataset (Electricity Transformer Dataset) is a repository that provides time series data collected during the operation of power transformers. This dataset contains various parameters of power transformers, among which data related to oil temperature is used to monitor the condition of the transformer, predict failures, and optimize maintenance.

- **Characteristics**:
- **Time series data**: Each parameter records changes over time, and oil temperature data in particular is affected by external factors and internal operating conditions that vary over time.
- **High data accuracy**: The data is recorded with high accuracy during the operation of the transformer and contains monitoring data over a long period of time.
- **Practical application**: These data provide useful information for equipment condition monitoring and predictive maintenance in practice.

- **How ​​to use**:
- The data will be used for time series analysis focusing on oil temperature prediction in power transformers.
- Use ett.csv included in the repository for the data to be used.
- For details on the data and how to use it, see the documentation in the [ETDataset GitHub repository](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset).
